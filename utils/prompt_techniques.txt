I want you to design a very clear system message and prompt with high accuracy that will leave no room for hallucination for generative ai model.           
In this prompt design, I want the generative ai model to answer a question, based on the context ( a very big chunk of text, 
maybe 2000 words or more) . Make sure the generative AI model recall the instructions clearly because the context is very big text. 
If the model can not find the answer of this question based on context, then I want the model to respond with a 
1. "I am sorry, but I can not provide an answer based on information from the given documents." 
If the model does find an answer, then I want the model to  
1. Make the Answer very simple and so everyone can understand. 
2. Use a suitable answering format, so the reader can easliy read the answer.
